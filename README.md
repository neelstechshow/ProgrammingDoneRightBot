# ProgrammingDoneRightBot
This is the github file for my discord bot made in Python, this is for my discord server
The main.py file has the code for my discord bot, and the keep_alive file is just a web server paired with uptime robot so that my bot can stay active forever. 
Let me know if there is anything I should add/remove and I'll try my best. Also if you want to see my bot in action join my discord server: discord.gg/UbWFK4je7B
